  Hello! My name is Thanish Kashyap. I am a 9th grader at MHS in Omaha, NE. I would say that my three favorite activities are playing video games, reading, and playing tennis.
</p>
<br>
<p id="p2">
My favorite video game is probably <a href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/"> Minecraft.</a> My favorite book series is <a href="http://brandonmull.com/category/fablehaven/"> Fablehaven </a>, by Brandon Mull. I think out of all the tennis players, my favorite would be <a href="https://www.rogerfederer.com/"> Roger Federer</a>.</p>
